 Creating a Hospital Management System (HMS) using Java Swing, AWT, and SQL involves several steps. Below is an outline of how you can design and implement this system:
 The Hospital Management System will allow users to manage patient information, doctor details, appointments, medicine inventory
 Technologies Used:-
Java Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface (GUI).
SQL Database (MySQL) for data storage.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect Java application with SQL database.
Admin selects "Manage Patients" and adds a new patient through the Swing form.
Deployment:-
Once you finish coding and testing the application, you can package the program into a .jar file for deployment.
Conclusion:-
This project will require knowledge of Java Swing for the GUI, JDBC for database interaction, and SQL for managing data. You'll need to ensure that the application is user-friendly, responsive, and performs operations securely.
